# KIJ_Assignment1

Create an application that can send encrypted files to another computer using ALL OF the following encryption algorithms:

AES
RC4
DES

You may use any cryptography library in any language (e.g., BouncyCastle, Java Crypto, PyCrypto, etc)

You need to use one of the non-ECB operation modes for the block cipher (i.e., CBC, CFB, OFB, CTR)

Extra mark if you implement one of the block ciphers from scratch

The program must be bug-free

Analyse the difference (e.g., security, running time, features, the resulting cipher text, etc) between each cipher

Run the program multiple times!

Write a short report of the analysis result and upload it to Classroom

The key may be static / hardcoded

You are free to use any programming language

Extra mark for using C

Plagiarism will get you 0 mark

All code must be uploaded to GitHub and commits must be done regularly. Put the link to your group's Github repo on this spreadsheet ASAP.
